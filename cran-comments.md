New submission

I am indeed the maintainer and this is indeed a new submission, so that's correct.

Comments from previous submission round:
"Please explain all acronyms (e.g. RV) in your description to avoid misunderstandings."

To which I replied:
"Thank you for your review. It seems that the 'RV' from 'RV coefficient' is not an abbreviation for something (or at least not a known one; I've checked the literature and asked a colleague who has published many papers on the RV coefficient). I do agree that it is good to make it clear what we're referring to with 'RV coefficient'. Would it be sufficient if I add a reference: (Robert & Escoufier, 1976, <doi:10.2307/2347233>)?"

The reviewer agreed with this, hence I've made this change.
