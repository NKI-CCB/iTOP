Title: Inferring the Topology of Omics Data
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Nanne Aben

Description: Infers a topology of relationships between different datasets, such as multi-omics and phenotypic data recorded on the same samples. We based this methodology on the RV coefficient, a measure of matrix correlation, which we have extended for partial matrix correlations and binary data (Aben et al., 2018, in preparation).
