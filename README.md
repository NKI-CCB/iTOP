# iTOP
iTOP is the R package accompanying our publication on the inference of topologies of relationships between datasets, such as multi-omics and phenotypic data recorded on the same samples (Aben et al., 2018, in preparation). We based this methodology on the RV coefficient, a measure of matrix correlation, which we have extended for partial matrix correlations and binary data.

The R package is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/iTOP/index.html). It can be installed within R using:
```r
install.packages("iTOP")
```
A quick start can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/iTOP/vignettes/vignette.html). The reference manual can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/iTOP/iTOP.pdf).
