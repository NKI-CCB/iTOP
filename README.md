# iTOP
iTOP is the R package accompanying our publication on the inference of topologies of relationships between datasets, such as multi-omics and phenotypic data recorded on the same samples (Aben et al., 2018, in preparation). We based this methodology on the RV coefficient, a measure of matrix correlation, which we have extended for partial matrix correlations and binary data.

The R package can be installed within R using:
```r
library(devtools)
install_github("NKI-CCB/iTOP")
```
